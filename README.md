# Mounting a Laravel app using Docker

**WIP**

This repository provides a complete Docker-based environment for running a Laravel application using Docker Compose. It includes Nginx as the web server, MariaDB as the database, and a dedicated PHP container for the Laravel application. The services are fully integrated, allowing seamless communication between them. With this setup, you can quickly spin up a Laravel development environment without installing dependencies directly on your machine.

## Installation

1. git clone the repository
2. run `docker-compose up`
